<h3> About me </h3>

<h5>Past achievements </h5>
<p>
I started my o levels back in late 2016 and just like every 1st year at high
school, I was clueless about the fact that what the next 3 years entailed.
I went to LGS JT in Lahore and studied science subjects. In total I was
studying 8 subjects, though school was tough at first I gradually became
accustomed to my life at high school and finished my o levels with good
grades.I started my A levels in late 2019. I did it my o levels and a levels
from the same high school. I studied 5 subjects in a levels which included:

Physics

Chemistry

Maths

Computer Science

Economics

I studied these subjects for a whole year before I decided to drop economics.
I learned a lot in my a levels about computer science which has definitely
helped me out in my journey.

<h6>Current Situation</h6>
<p>â€‹I am a solitary and intrapersonal learner. I prefer assignments which
require practical work and academic settings which focus on a more hands-on
approach. I really like technology and I started getting into it a few years
ago. Being an avid fan of technology, makes me excited about any new thing
that is released, like new laptops, phones, tablets, ipads, gpus, processors
and much more. I also like to programme/code because it requires me to think
critically and use basic logic to make an application that can be helpful to
people or even to myself.
I started my journey into the world of coding during my a levels where I had
to study computer science. That was the point when I started developing a
profound interest in Web development and Graphic design. I have been
practicing both of these since the past 2 years and I have been getting
better at them every few months. I am planning to learn dive deeper into the
world of coding and proceed with my current hobbies.
